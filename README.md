# Repair Rush

Submitted as part of the Ubisoft API Toronto Hackathon challenges

## Inspiration

We couldn't think of an idea at first, but then we decided to interpret the theme of "Building" as a noun and came up with this niche game idea.

## What it does

You play as a repairman using keyboard inputs to move around the screen and repair holes on the side of a building. If the holes overwhelm you, the building falls apart and you get a game over.

## How we built it

We used the Ubisoft NEST game engine API and created the game in C++. Sprites of the entities in game were created with sprite sheets in Aseprite for static and animated objects.

## Challenges we ran into

All of our team members were not very familiar with C++ and game engine tweaking. Learning the language and understanding the game engine. Coming up with the game logic was also a new experience for us. A few of our team members had little knowledge in development flow, but we overcame this challenge with peer programming and strong communication.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we were able to come up with a silly idea and complete the MVP. If we had more time, we could implement some cooler features, such as falling debris and multiple stages.

## What's next for Repair Rush

Since we were only able to create a single stage, we would like to have a difficulty increasing game with falling obstacles that bring some more difficulty in the game.
